Jenkins is calling!
==============

Android mobile application which receives push messages from a Python server connected to Jenkins.

There are two types of notifications, showing a window which will override all the current windows which the mobile phone user is browsing
* Build failing - the application will show a window with Eduard Khil singing TROLOLO
* Build fixed - the application will show a window with Keyboard Cat playing the Keyboard (that's why he is Keyboard Cat, and Captain Obvious is Obvious)
